**ECHO** is a selective turn-memory framework for traceable context reconstruction in
agentic reinforcement learning, built on top of [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl).

Long-horizon language agents must act under bounded contexts while learning from
sparse outcome rewards. Common context-management methods make long rollouts
feasible by truncating history or folding multiple turns into rolling summaries,
but these transformations can weaken or remove source-level addressability. In
particular, once historical observations are collapsed into a single state,
outcome-based RL has no explicit route for assigning delayed credit back to the
original evidence turns that later decisions conditioned on.

ECHO addresses this with two coupled ideas:

- ✂️ **Prune to Act** — each completed turn is compressed into a *source-indexed*
  memory and retained in a persistent, non-collapsing archive. A bounded policy
  context is reconstructed by selecting relevant memories together with recent
  interactions.
- 🔍 **Trace to Learn** — the final reconstruction's selected source indices are
  reused as provenance routes, so positive outcome credit is routed to the final
  segment and the historical tokens that the policy actually reused.

On BrowseComp-Plus, ECHO reaches **43.4%** held-out accuracy, outperforming GRPO
(28.9%) and the rolling-summary baseline SUPO (36.1%), while using fewer turns and
lower trajectory volume than SUPO. The trained policy also improves zero-shot
generalization across multi-objective QA, code generation, and deep
information-seeking benchmarks on both dense (Qwen3-32B-Instruct) and MoE
(Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct) backbones.

## 🧠 Method

ECHO has two coupled stages: it **prunes** distant history into selectable,
source-indexed memory so the policy can keep acting under a bounded context, and
it **traces** the final reconstruction's source indices through the update so
positive credit flows only along the evidence path the policy actually reused.

### 💡 Motivation

| History transformation | Managed state | Reconstruction form | Source trace | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Append-only | $`H_j^{\mathrm{pre}}`$ | $`H_j^{\mathrm{pre}} \oplus H_{j,t}^{\mathrm{loc}}`$ | Explicit | Vanilla prompting |
| Deletion / pruning | $`C_j \subseteq H_j^{\mathrm{pre}}`$ | $`\mathrm{Render}(C_j, H_{j,t}^{\mathrm{loc}}; B)`$ | Partial / lost | Sliding window<sup>R</sup>, Agent-Omit<sup>A</sup> |
| Edited memory state | $`B_j`$ | $`\mathrm{Render}(B_j, H_{j,t}^{\mathrm{loc}}; B)`$ | Action-traced | MemAct<sup>A</sup>, Memory-R1<sup>A</sup> |
| Collapsed folding | $`z_j=C(z_{j-1},\sigma_{j-1})`$ | $`\mathrm{Render}(z_j) \oplus H_{j,t}^{\mathrm{loc}}`$ | Collapsed | SUPO<sup>R</sup>, FoldGRPO<sup>A</sup> |
| **Selective turn memory** | $`\mathcal{E}_j=\{e_i\}_{i \le K_{j-1}}`$ | $`\mathrm{Render}(\mathcal{E}_j[\hat I_j]) \oplus H_{j,t}^{\mathrm{loc}}`$ | **Source-indexed** | **ECHO<sup>R</sup>** |

> Methods are grouped by how they transform completed history. Superscripts
> describe the separate reconstruction trigger: **R** is rule-triggered and
> **A** is action-triggered. “Source trace” asks whether reconstructed context
> remains addressable at the level of the original environment turns.
>
> After each completed tool-use turn, the same policy writes a compact finding and
> appends its source index, compact action, and finding to a persistent,
> non-collapsing archive. At a reconstruction boundary, the policy selects useful
> records and combines them with automatically retained recent turns. Selection
> changes only the bounded active view; unselected records remain available at
> later boundaries. The selected source indices are used both to reconstruct
> context and to route delayed credit during learning.

### 🎯 Credit Assignment

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/echo_ca.png" width="98%" alt="Provenance-guided credit assignment in ECHO">
</div>

> **Overview of ECHO.** GRPO and SUPO apply the signed trajectory advantage
> *densely* to all trainable response tokens (in SUPO, including rolling-summary
> tokens), so the outcome reward does not distinguish useful evidence from
> redundant searches. ECHO instead uses a **final-trace approximation**: source
> turns selected into the final reconstructed context define the historical tokens
> eligible for credit. Its token-level mask keeps **(i)** every trainable token in
> the final saved segment, **(ii)** trainable assistant/action tokens from those
> selected source turns, **(iii)** their memory-finding tokens, and **(iv)**
> generated memory-selection spans. The final saved segment begins after the last
> context reconstruction (or at rollout start if no reconstruction occurs) and
> includes assistant reasoning and tool-call tokens through the terminal response.
> Only a rollout with positive group-relative advantage reinforces this trace;
> zero- or negative-advantage rollouts receive no ECHO update. Dense signed credit
> over all response tokens is retained only as the "w/o traceable CA" ablation.

## 🛠️ Installation

Reference environment used for the paper:

- 🐍 Python 3.10, CUDA 12.8
- 🖥️ GPU: NVIDIA H800 (80GB), 8 GPUs per node
- ⚙️ PyTorch 2.7.1+cu128, sglang 0.4.10, megatron-core 0.13.2
- transformer_engine 2.5.0, flash_attn 2.7.4.post1, flashinfer 0.2.6.post1

The CUDA-compiled stack (torch / sglang / megatron-core / transformer_engine /
flash_attn / flashinfer / apex) must be installed in order against your CUDA
toolkit — see [`requirements-cuda.txt`](requirements-cuda.txt) for the pinned
versions and suggested install order. After the CUDA stack is in place:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

---

## 📦 Data Preparation

ECHO is trained and evaluated on
[BrowseComp-Plus](https://github.com/texttron/BrowseComp-Plus).

You can download the preprocessed ECHO data from
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/b1Ack714/echo):

```bash
huggingface-cli download b1Ack714/echo \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --local-dir /path/to/browsecomp-plus-processed
```

Then point the training scripts at that directory:

```bash
export DATA_DIR=/path/to/browsecomp-plus-processed
```

Alternatively, build the prompt parquet files from a local BrowseComp-Plus copy
with:

```bash
python3 examples/data_preprocess/bcp_paper_prompt.py --data-dir "$DATA_DIR"
```

This reads `train.parquet` and `test.parquet` and writes `train.paper.parquet`
and `test.paper.parquet` under `DATA_DIR`. Training also requires either the
official corpus at `$DATA_DIR/corpus.parquet` or a prebuilt dense cache at
`$DATA_DIR/browsecomp_dense_cache.pkl`. To build the cache ahead of time:

```bash
python3 examples/sglang_multiturn/build_embed_index.py \
  --corpus_file "$DATA_DIR/corpus.parquet" \
  --model /path/to/Qwen3-Embedding-8B \
  --output "$DATA_DIR/browsecomp_dense_cache.pkl"
```

If the corpus exists but the cache does not, the training script builds the
cache when it launches the dense retrieval service
(`examples/sglang_multiturn/browsecomp_retrieval_server.py`).

---

## 🚀 Training

The scripts target a 4-node × 8×H800 setup with the Megatron backend and SGLang
rollout. Before launching, export the required paths (scripts fail fast if these
are unset):

```bash
export VENV_PATH=/path/to/your/venv               # Python virtualenv
export MODEL_PATH=/path/to/Qwen3-32B              # policy model
export RETRIEVER_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/Qwen3-Embedding-8B
export DATA_DIR=/path/to/browsecomp-plus-processed  # contains *.paper.parquet
export TRAINER_IPS=10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2,10.0.0.3,10.0.0.4

# Weights & Biases: configure online logging, or use WANDB_MODE=offline
export WANDB_API_KEY=...   export WANDB_ENTITY=...
# export WANDB_MODE=offline
```

Launch from the first IP in `TRAINER_IPS`. The four nodes must have passwordless
SSH connectivity and consistent access to the virtual environment, model, and
data paths. Cluster environments may provide the node list through
`PADDLE_TRAINERS` instead.

**⚖️ LLM-judge reward.** The reward function (`verl/utils/reward_score/bc_p_llm_judge.py`)
scores answers with an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint. Point it at any
compatible API (OpenAI, DeepSeek, a self-hosted vLLM/SGLang server, etc.) via:

```bash
export BCP_JUDGE_API_BASE="https://api.openai.com/v1"   # any OpenAI-compatible base URL
export BCP_JUDGE_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"                     # judge model name on that endpoint
export BCP_JUDGE_API_KEY_ENV="OPENAI_API_KEY"           # name of the env var holding the key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."                          # the key itself (name must match above)
```

The script reads the key from the environment variable named by
`BCP_JUDGE_API_KEY_ENV` (default `ONEAPI_KEY`) and fails fast if it is unset, so
there are no hardcoded credentials. Use your own provider and key.

The launchers also load `${PROJECT_DIR}/.env` when it exists. Start from
`.env.example`; `.env` is ignored by git and is intended for machine-specific
paths and endpoint settings. Keep API keys in the process environment rather
than in that file.

For multi-node runs, the node list is resolved by `bcp_node_utils.sh` from
`TRAINER_IPS` (or the cluster-provided `PADDLE_TRAINERS`).

Run from the project root, e.g.:

```bash
bash examples/sglang_multiturn/run_qwen3-32b_bcp_echo-ca_fully_async_4node.sh
```

To validate paths, imports, node selection, parallelism, and generated tool
configuration without starting Ray or using GPUs:

```bash
BCP_PREFLIGHT_ONLY=1 BCP_SKIP_REMOTE_CHECK=1 \
  bash examples/sglang_multiturn/run_qwen3-30b-a3b_bcp_echo-ca_fully_async_4node.sh
```

Omit `BCP_SKIP_REMOTE_CHECK=1` to include passwordless-SSH checks for every
configured node. Shell command tracing is disabled by default so secrets cannot
be written to logs; set `BCP_SHELL_TRACE=1` only for non-sensitive debugging.

### 🔬 Reproducing Ablations

Ablation variants reuse the same core scripts and are toggled through environment
variables (see the top of each script for the full list). Key knobs:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONTEXT_COMPRESSION_METHOD` | `echo_e2e` | Context reconstruction strategy: `echo_e2e` (learned selection), `semantic_selection` (static top-k retrieval), `truncate` (left-truncation), `summary` (SUPO rolling summary) |
| `ECHO_CREDIT_METHOD` | `token` | Credit routing: `token` (provenance-guided ECHO), `traj` (coarser selected-segment credit), `none` (dense signed credit over all response tokens) |
| `ECHO_RECENT_TURNS` | `3` | Number of most-recent turns always kept during reconstruction |
| `WORKING_CONTEXT_LENGTH` | `32768` | Single-segment token threshold that triggers compression |
| `MAX_SUMMARY_ROUNDS` | `5` | Max compression rounds before a rollout is marked overlong |
| `SEMANTIC_SELECTION_FULL_OBSERVATION` | `False` | When using `semantic_selection`, retrieve full observations instead of compact findings |
| `ECHO_NEG_PENALTY_RATIO` | `0.0` | Scale for dense signed updates on negative rollouts |
| `ECHO_GRAPH_GAMMA_TURN` | `1.0` | Discount on local consecutive-turn graph edges |
| `ECHO_GRAPH_GAMMA_SEGMENT` | `0.9` | Discount across explicit selection boundaries |
| `ECHO_GRAPH_AGGREGATION` | `sum` | Combine downstream graph credit with `sum` or `max` |
| `ECHO_GRAPH_CLIP_MAX` | `1.0` | Positive graph-credit cap; use `none` to disable clipping |

### ⏱️ Training Efficiency

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/training_efficiency_comparison_smoothed.png" width="98%" alt="Training efficiency comparison across GRPO, ECHO, and SUPO">
</div>

ECHO incurs early overhead because the policy writes a finding after each
completed tool turn and generates selection actions at reconstruction boundaries.
Later in training, however, its bounded selected view limits turn proliferation;
step, generation, and tool-call time remain lower than SUPO while accuracy is
higher.

### 🌐 Zero-shot Generalization

Without benchmark-specific further training, the BrowseComp-Plus-trained policy
is evaluated in the same agent-loop framework across three out-of-domain
families: Multi-Objective QA (2–16 objectives), Code Generation (CodeGym,
LoCoBench-Agent), and Deep Information Seeking (GAIA, HLE, Frames). These results
measure zero-shot agentic transfer rather than bare-model generation. **Bold** =
best, _underline_ = second-best. CA = credit assignment. Column abbreviations:
**MO-Avg** = Multi-Objective QA average; **LoCo** = LoCoBench-Agent.

ECHO achieves the best dense-backbone average at **40.2%**, compared with 33.6%
for GRPO and 34.8% for SUPO. On the MoE backbone, it reaches **30.5%**, compared
with 26.9% for SUPO. Replacing learned selection with Top-K retrieval lowers the
